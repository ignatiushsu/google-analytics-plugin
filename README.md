# Google-Analytics-Plugin #

## Description ##

Enhancements to Google Analytics. This plugin enhances online measurement of sites that are tracked through Google Analytics (GA) Async. The plugin provides the following functionality:
* submits events to GA when visitors click on document/file links, external links and email addresses links
* tracks 404 pages by submitting page referral data to GA
* tracks visitors clicking across multiple domain
* tracks redirects as events (through a configurable hash tag in the URL) and can provide visitors with a message about redirect

Requires jQuery 1.4.2 or higher and GA async. Testged on jQuery versions 1.4.2, 1.6.1 and 1.9.1. Read the change log + developer notes.
